# SkillCraft Internship â€“ Data Visualization

This repository contains my work completed during the **Web Development Internship at SkillCraft Technology**.  
The code demonstrates the use of **Python (Pandas + Matplotlib)** for data analysis and visualization.

## ðŸ“Œ Task 01: Population Distribution by Age
We created a **bar chart** to visualize India's population distribution by age groups (2022).

### Dataset
The dataset (`india_age_distribution_2022.csv`) includes:
- Age Group
- Population (in millions)
- Percentage

### Visualization
The script (`population_chart.py`) reads the dataset and generates the chart:

![Population Chart](india_age_bar_chart.png)

### Insights
- 0â€“20 years: 512 million (36.1%)  
- 21â€“64 years: 807 million (57.0%)  
- 65+ years: 98 million (6.9%)  

Most of the population (57%) is in the working-age group, highlighting Indiaâ€™s young demographic profile.
